# About Pascal Bauermeister

### Summary
I lead and build full-stack systems on cloud (GCP) and on-prem infrastructure — covering backend, infrastructure automation, and system architecture. I create custom Docker base images, manage infrastructure as code, and deploy production services with optimized compute, storage, networking, and cost efficiency.

I’ve led software, DevOps, and R&D teams in startups and enterprises. My scope includes system design, release management, vendor coordination, and Agile/DevOps rollout. I focus on reliable, reproducible, lean systems with hands-on full-stack ownership and cost-aware delivery.

My background spans embedded systems and real-time C programming to distributed Python platforms and CI/CD automation.

### Notable achievements

- Built CI/CD + infra platform (cloud/on-prem, GCP) for IoT, observability, asset management, data science
- Delivered IT monitoring for 2, 000+ corporate servers — 6× cost reduction
- Co-founded child protection platform with backend, mobile, ML, chatbot
- Led software team for Android-controlled insulin pump — IEC 62304 compliance, test automation
- Created Linux/Java/Bluetooth mobile platform — predated Android concepts by 3 years
- Designed firmware + protocols for EU’s 1st power-line carrier network — contributed to IEC 61334/62056
