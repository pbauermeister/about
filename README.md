# About Pascal Bauermeister

EPFL engineer <br />
Strategic Tech Lead bridging embedded, DevOps, and cloud platform architecture <br />
Builder of durable systems and self-sustaining teams

### Summary
I lead and build full-stack systems on cloud (GCP) and on-prem infrastructure. My work spans backend development, infrastructure automation, and system architecture. I craft advanced Docker images, manage infrastructure as code, and deploy production-grade scalable services with tuned compute, storage, networking, and cost efficiency.

I’ve led software, DevOps, and R&D teams in startups and enterprises. My responsibilities included system design, release management, vendor management, and Agile/DevOps rollout.

My background spans embedded systems and real-time C programming to distributed Python cloud data platforms and CI/CD automation.

While focusing on reliable, reproducible, lean systems with hands-on full-stack ownership and cost-aware delivery, I also firmly believe in architectural clarity, collaborative design and shared purpose: one mind alone is rarely enough.

### Notable achievements
- Built grid analytics platform (GCP+on-prem) for IoT, asset mgmt, and predictive insights
- 6× cost reduction by building IT monitoring for 2K+ servers at Switzerland’s largest utility
- Co-founded a child protection platform with full-stack backend, Android, ML, and chatbot
- Led Android-controlled insulin pump platform (with IEC 62304 compliance)
- Invented mobile architecture (Linux, Java, Bluetooth) 3 years before Android emerged
- Designed Europe’s first PLC smart metering network; basis of IEC 61334 / 62056 standards; my firmware design resurfaced 16 years later as 2 commercial chipsets

### Core Strengths
- Cross-functional leadership across DevOps, R&D, full-stack and embedded
- Cost-aware, business-aligned engineering practices
- Systems reproducibility, automation and deterministic environments
- Full-stack builder with embedded → backend → mobile → cloud lifecycle ownership
- Zero-trust infrastructure and observability at scale
- Resolved challenges where more traditional approaches had reached their limits

### Languages
French (native), English (fluent), German (fluent, spoken at home)

### Education
M. Sc Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) in Micro Engineering, 1990.

### Certifications
- ITIL® Foundation
- HERMES 5
